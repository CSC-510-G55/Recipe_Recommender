## Code of Conduct
All contributors should abide by the terms of the [code of conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). Please read this carefully before contributing.

## Pull Request Submission Guidelines
### Install Git 
Install and configure the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) on your local machine.

[Set Up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart) is a good source for you to set up.

### Fork Our Repositroy
To contribute code to our product, you must have a Github account so you could push code to your own fork and open Pull Requests in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gokul-koganti/Recipe_Recommender/)

### Work On Your Own branch
Once done and you have the code locally on the disk, you can get started. We advice to not work directly on the master branch, but to create a separate branch for each issue you are working on. That way you can easily switch between different work, and you can update each one for latest changes on upstream master individually.

### Pull Request Review
Once after submitting a pull request, we will be reviewing it and get back to you on any questions regarding the changes made.

### Documentation Style Guide  
   * Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
